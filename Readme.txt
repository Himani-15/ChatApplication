----------------------------------------------------

This README file explains how to use the Chat Application program which is developed
using Java language.

The Chat Application program includes Java source code files for the Server and 
Client which acts as users of Chat Application. The users are able to send messages 
to each other and on sending "Exit" as message, the program will be terminated.

Note that the program requires Java 11 or higher. If not installed, you can download
it from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html.

-----COMPILE AND RUN ON THE COMMAND LINE-----

Steps to compile the files:

1) Open two different cmd and change the path to where your files are located using 
   the "cd" command.
2) You can then compile the files using the java command "javac". For example:
			javac Example.java
   You need to compile both Server.java and Client.java files.
3) On executing this command, it will create .class file for the each source code file 
   which you compiled.

Steps to run the program:

1) To execute the Server and Client, use the java command "java classname" on each cmd 
   (one for Server and other for Client). For Example:
			java Server
2) You can send messages from Server and Client as many times as you want.
2) To exit from the program, type "Exit" as message from either Server or Client.
